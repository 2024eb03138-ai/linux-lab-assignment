Step 1:
A file named sample_data.txt was created in the home directory with sample content.

Step 2:
A hard link named sample_hard.txt was created, pointing to the same inode as sample_data.txt.

Step 3:
A symbolic link named sample_soft.txt was created, which points to the original file path.

Step 4:
The ls -li command was used to display inode numbers of all files.

Step 5:
sample_data.txt and sample_hard.txt share the same inode because hard links reference the same file data.
sample_soft.txt has a different inode because it only stores the path to the original file.

Step 6:
The ls -l command was used to display permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps of the file.

Step 7:
The du -sh command shows total disk usage of the home directory in human-readable format.

Step 8:
The ls -lh command displays the size of each file in the home directory.

Step 9:
The symbolic link was deleted, and the original file remained unaffected, proving links are independent.

Step 10:
The du command shows disk usage of directories, while the df command displays filesystem-wide disk space usage.
